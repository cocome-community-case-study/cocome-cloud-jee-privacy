@misc{Heinrich.01.01.2015,
 abstract = {Cloud applications are subject to continuous change due to modifications of the software application itself and, in particular, its environment. To manage changes, cloud-based systems provide diverse self-adaptation mechanisms based on run-time models. Observed run-time models are means for leveraging self-adaption, however, are hard to apply during software evolution as they are usually too detailed for comprehension by humans.

In this paper, we propose iObserve, an approach to cloud-based system adaptation and evolution through run-time observation and continuous quality analysis. With iObserve, run-time adaptation and evolution are two mutual, interwoven activities that influence each other. Central to iObserve is (a) the specification of the correspondence between observation results and design models, and (b) their use in both adaptation and evolution. Run-time observation data is promoted to meaningful values mapped to design models, thereby continuously updating and calibrating those design models during run-time while keeping the models comprehensible by humans. This engineering approach allows for automated adaptation at run-time and simultaneously supports software evolution. Model-driven software engineering is employed for various purposes such as monitoring instrumentation and model transformation. We report on the experimental evaluation of this approach in lab experiments using the CoCoME benchmark deployed on an OpenStack cloud.},

@inproceedings{Martens.2010,
 abstract = {Quantitative prediction of quality properties (i.e. extra-functional properties such as performance, reliability, and cost) of software architectures during design supports a systematic software engineering approach. Designing architectures that exhibit a good trade-off between multiple quality criteria is hard, because even after a functional design has been created, many remaining degrees of freedom in the software architecture span a large, discontinuous design space. In current practice, software architects try to find solutions manually, which is time-consuming, can be error-prone and can lead to suboptimal designs. We propose an automated approach to search the design space for good solutions. Starting with a given initial architectural model, the approach iteratively modifies and evaluates architectural models. Our approach applies a multi-criteria genetic algorithm to software architectures modelled with the Palladio Component Model. It supports quantitative performance, reliability, and cost prediction and can be extended to other quantitative quality criteria of software architectures. We validate the applicability of our approach by applying it to an architecture model of a component-based business information system and analyse its quality criteria trade-offs by automatically investigating more than 1200 alternative design candidates.},
